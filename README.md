Paper:Comparison of diff. approches to handle scalability issues for big data through amount of devices in IoT
Keywords: Scalability, IoT, Cloud, M2M, Fog, Edge

Compared Approaches:
1.Paper: "Efficent and scalable IoT service delivery on Cloud"
Implementation of domain mediation
State of the art isolated Building management systems (BMS)
Approach:
diversity of exiting domain-specific data models has introduced another layer of heterogeneity. Therefore we propose domain mediators to mediate the interfaces between different gateways in the same application domain.
